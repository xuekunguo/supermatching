\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:con}

We have proposed a symmetry detection algorithm for discovering and extracting partial symmetries of 3D geometric models.
The algorithm could detects the general symmetry types, such as the rotation, translation, and mirroring symmetry.
It is robust as relying on the shape segmentation, and shows the advantage over the graph matching using salient feature lines.
Our algorithm is provably effective, easy to implement, and applicable to a wide range of 3D shapes.

\paragraph{Discussion.} 
The main limitation of our symmetry detection algorithm stems from the foundation that we build it by using the segmentation algorithm.
In presence of significant noise, this assumption breaks down for our choice of meaningful segmentation, 
thus forcing the algorithm to the unstable scenario.
As the rapid development and maturity of meaningful segmentation~\cite{Shamir2008}, 
more segmentation algorithm would and could be employed to produce more reasonable decomposition.
In addition, it is useful and necessary to develop more efficient algorithm by resorting to multi-resolution or parallelization
techniques (e.g., using the GPU) to improve the speed of the algorithm.
