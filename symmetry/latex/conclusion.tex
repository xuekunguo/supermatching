\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:con}

We have proposed a symmetry detection algorithm for discovering and extracting partial approximate symmetries of 3D geometric models.
It can detect  rotational, translational, and mirror symmetries.
It is based on first performing shape segmentation, and performs better than graph matching using salient feature lines.
Our algorithm is effective, easy to implement, and applicable to a wide range of 3D shapes.

Our symmetry detection algorithm relies on helpful outputs from a segmentation algorithm
which may be hard to ensure in the presence of significant noise. 
We have used a general purpose segmentation algorithm, but better results are likely to be achieved if the 
segmentation algorithm itself is symmetry aware.
Further improvements both in performance and quality of results
is likely to arise through use of  multi-resolution approaches, as well as  parallelization
techniques.
