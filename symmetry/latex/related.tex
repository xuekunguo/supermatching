Symmetry detection and analysis have been thoroughly studied from theoretic, algorithmic, and applicative aspects during the last two decades.
There exists a significant number of papers proposed for this purpose, which could be mainly classified into \emph{global} and \emph{partial} types.
As we will aim to detect the intrinsic symmetry in 3D shapes in this paper, we concentrate on the most relevant 3D shape symmetry methods and recent advances in the intrinsic topic.
For the comprehensive review, please refer to papers~\cite{Xu2009,Berner2011}.

A common approach is to identify the global symmetry detection in Euclidean space to the clusters in the transformation space~\cite{mitra2006,podolak2006,pauly2008}. Other approaches~\cite{bokeloh2009,Berner2011} formulate the symmetry detection as partial graph matching, and compute the reliable line features from scanned data.
Extrinsic symmetry methods always employed symmetry of the Euclidean space for detecting symmetries~\cite{zabrodsky1997,mitra2006,podolak2006},
and patterns~\cite{pauly2008,bokeloh2009,yeh2009,Berner2011}.

Recent works have focused on analyzing partial and approximate symmetries, which is more difficult than the extrinsic, given the high dimensionality of the non-rigid transformation.
is more difficult than global extrinsic symmetries.
Similar to extrinsic symmetry, intrinsic symmetry could be characterized by global~\cite{ovsjanikov2008,bronstein2009,Ben-Chen2010,Bokeloh2010,Chertok2010,Lipman2010,Kim2010,Hooda2011,kim2011} and partial~\cite{Lasowski2009,Xu2009,Mitra2010,Raviv2010,Bronstein2011} cases. While from the transformation formulation viewpoint, intrinsic symmetry algorithms are striving for the compact representation using parameters, e.g., translation, rotation, scaling, and reflection. Except an alternative way of detecting global intrinsic symmetry is using the approximate killing vector field~\cite{Ben-Chen2010} from a continuous perspective, most algorithms considered discrete symmetries by sampling.
Ovsjanikov et al. perform global intrinsic symmetry detection using eigenanalysis of the surface Laplace-Beltrami operator~\cite{ovsjanikov2008}, then resorting to the heat kernel maps~\cite{Ovsjanikov2010}. By utilizing the Mobius transformation and conformal mapping, two robust symmetry detection algorithms were proposed by Kim and his coworkers~\cite{Kim2010,Kim2011}. Meanwhile, the Global MultiDimensional Scaling (GMDS) computation was thoroughly studied by Bronstein's researching team~\cite{bronstein2006,bronstein2009,Raviv2010,Bronstein2011} to detect the extrinsic and intrinsic symmetries, and mainly applied to the shape invariant retrieval applications. In addition, other researchers proposed variant symmetry methods by using different techniques, e.g., Markov random field model~\cite{Lasowski2009}, symmetry axis voting~\cite{Xu2009}, Eigen analysis~\cite{Chertok2010,Lipman2010}, Pseudo-polar Fourier Transform~\cite{Bermanis2010}, etc.

It is more challenging to detect the partial symmetry for 3D shapes. For the general partial symmetries, our algorithm would solve the reflectional, rotational and translational problems in one unified framework. Our approach is some similar to the symmetry detection using feature lines~\cite{Berner2011}, but going beyond it by stably handling more challenging input data.
