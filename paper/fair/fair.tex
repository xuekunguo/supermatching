%%% The ``\documentclass'' command has one parameter, based on the kind of
%%% document you are preparing.
%%%
%%% [annual] - Technical paper accepted for presentation at the ACM SIGGRAPH
%%%   or SIGGRAPH Asia annual conference.
%%% [sponsored] - Short or full-length technical paper accepted for
%%%   presentation at an event sponsored by ACM SIGGRAPH
%%%   (but not the annual conference Technical Papers program).
%%% [abstract] - A one-page abstract of your accepted content
%%%   (Technical Sketches, Posters, Emerging Technologies, etc.).
%%%   Content greater than one page in length should use the "[sponsored]"
%%%   parameter.
%%% [preprint] - A preprint version of your final content.
%%% [review] - A technical paper submitted for review. Includes line
%%%   numbers and anonymization of author and affiliation information.

\documentclass[review]{acmsiggraph}

%%% If you are submitting your paper to one of our annual conferences - the
%%% ACM SIGGRAPH conference held in North America, or the SIGGRAPH Asia
%%% conference held in Southeast Asia - there are several commands you should
%%% consider using in the preparation of your document.

%%% 1. ``\TOGonlineID''
%%% When you submit your paper for review, please use the ``\TOGonlineID''
%%% command to include the online ID value assigned to your paper by the
%%% submission management system. Replace '45678' with the value you were
%%% assigned.

\TOGonlineid{0208}

%%% 2. ``\TOGvolume'' and ``\TOGnumber''
%%% If you are preparing a preprint of your accepted paper, and your paper
%%% will be published in an issue of the ACM ``Transactions on Graphics''
%%% journal, replace the ``0'' values in the commands below with the correct
%%% volume and number values for that issue - you'll get them before your
%%% final paper is due.

\TOGvolume{0}
\TOGnumber{0}

%%% 3. ``TOGarticleDOI''
%%% The ``TOGarticleDOI'' command accepts the DOI information provided to you
%%% during production, and which makes up the URLs which identifies the ACM
%%% article page and direct PDF link in the ACM Digital Library.
%%% Replace ``1111111.2222222'' with the values you are given.

\TOGarticleDOI{1111111.2222222}

%%% 4. ``\TOGprojectURL'', ``\TOGvideoURL'', ``\TOGdataURL'', ``\TOGcodeURL''
%%% If you would like to include links to personal repositories for auxiliary
%%% material related your research contribution, you may use one or more of
%%% these commands to define an appropriate URL. The ``\TOGlinkslist'' command
%%% found just before the first section of your document will add hyperlinked
%%% icons to your document, in addition to hyperlinked icons which point to
%%% the ACM Digital Library article page and the ACM Digital Library-held PDF.
