Feature matching is a challenging problem lying at the heart of numerous computer graphics and computer vision applications.
We present here the \emph{SuperMatching} feature matching algorithm for finding correspondences between two sets of features.
SuperMatching finds matches between feature points by considering triangles or higher-order polygons formed by them, going beyond the pointwise and pairwise approaches typically used.
SuperMatching is formulated as a supersymmetric-tensor-based matching scheme,
casting feature matching as a higher-order graph matching problem.
The supersymmetric tensor represents an affinity metric which takes into account geometric constraints between features.
SuperMatching exploits a compact form of this affinity tensor,
whilst also taking advantage of supersymmetry to devise an
efficient sampling strategy to estimate the affinity tensor.
Matching is performed by computing a rank-one approximation of the tensor directly
using a higher-order power iteration solution.
Experiments on both synthetic and real captured data show that
our algorithm provides accurate feature matching in the general way by testing various 2D and 3D feature kinds,
and is more accurate than the state-of-the-art approaches with competitive computational cost.
