We present a feature matching algorithm for finding correspondences between two sets of features.
Our approach is based on finding matching triangles and quadrangles, going beyond the single (point) and pairwise (segment) of features typically used.
Our algorithm is formulated as supersymmetric-tensor-based higher-order matching scheme,
the higher-order affinity measures taking into account matches between more than a single or pairwise features.
We exploit a compact form of this affinity tensor, taking advantage of supersymmetry to devise an efficient sampling strategy to create the affinity tensor.
Matching is performed using the rank-one approximation of the tensor directly with a higher-order power method.
Experiments on both synthetic and real RGB images and depth videos show that
our algorithm provides accurate and robust matching of feature correspondences in the complex scenario.
