Feature matching is a challenging problem lying at the heart of numerous computer graphics and computer vision applications.
We present here the \emph{SuperMatching} feature matching algorithm for finding correspondences between two sets of features.
SuperMatching finds matches of feature points by considering triangle or higher-order polygons formed by such points, going beyond the pointwise and pairwise approaches typically used.
It is formulated as a supersymmetric-tensor-based matching scheme,
casting feature matching as a higher-order graph matching problem.
The supersymmetric tensor represents an affinity metric which takes into account geometric constraints between features.
SuperMatching exploits a compact form of this affinity tensor,
whilst also taking advantage of supersymmetry to devise an
efficient sampling strategy to create the affinity tensor.
Matching is performed by computing a rank-one approximation of the tensor directly
using a higher-order power solution method.
Experiments on both synthetic and real captured data show that
our algorithm provides accurate and robust feature matching even in complex cases.
