Matching is one challenging problem in the literature and forms the basis of numerous Computer Graphics and Computer Vision applications. 
In the paper, we present a feature matching algorithm, named SuperMatching, for finding correspondences between two sets of features.
SuperMatching working in the way finding matching constrained by triangles and higher polygons (e.g., quadrangles) aspects, 
going beyond the single (point) and pairwise (segment) of features typically used.
SuperMatching is formulated as supersymmetric-tensor-based matching scheme,
by casting features matching into a higher-order graph matching problem.
The higher-order affinity metric of supersymmetric tensor considers the stable geometric constraints among features.
SuperMatching exploits a compact form of this affinity tensor, also takes advantage of supersymmetry to devise an efficient sampling strategy to create the affinity tensor.
Matching is performed using the rank-one approximation of the tensor directly with a higher-order power solving method.
Experiments on both synthetic and real scanned data show that 
our algorithm provides accurate and robust features matching in complex scenario.
